### Mistralys web development hub 

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

Mistralys is my (Sebastian Mordziol) web development company based in France.

I started out as a graphics designer back when dial up modems were a thing, and over the years slipped into programming with PHP and C#, because combining both worlds was really fun. Being able to give life to my own graphical creations is always a thrill - as is programming things that work on their own. Even if it is all immaterial, it still gives a sense of achievement - especially if you build something that other people gain something from.

Lately I have been migrating all my leftover SVN repositories to GIT (hurray!), and discovered this profile readme in the process. Neat :D
