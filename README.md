### Mistralys web development hub 

Hi there!👋

My name is Sebastian Mordziol, web designer and developer by trade. I started out as a graphics designer back when dial up modems were a thing, and over the years slipped into programming with PHP and C#, because combining both worlds was really fun. Being able to give life to my own graphical creations is always a thrill - as is programming things that work on their own. Even if it is all immaterial, it still gives a sense of achievement - especially if you build something that other people gain something from.

In this hub I keep my open source PHP libraries, as well as some gaming resources.

Here's a quick overview of my main projects:

- [Application Utils](https://github.com/Mistralys/application-utils)
- [Application Framework](https://github.com/Mistralys/application-framework)
- [Mailcode](https://github.com/Mistralys/mailcode)

As well as a few gaming-related things:

- [Cyberpunk 2077 clothing mods database](https://github.com/Mistralys/cyberpunk-mod-db)
- [X4 game notes](https://github.com/Mistralys/x4-game-notes)
- [X4 savegame parser](https://github.com/Mistralys/x4-savegame-parser)

> NOTE: "Mistralys" is the name of my web development company. I have closed it some time ago to join the [IONOS](https://ionos.com) group.
